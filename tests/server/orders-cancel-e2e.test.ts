/**
 * The cancel guard, end to end: route → ledger → reconcile loop.
 *
 * The unit tests pin that DELETE /api/orders/:id refuses an engine-owned id.
 * This one pins what that refusal BUYS: drive a real pair to a resting maker,
 * try to hand-cancel it through the route by both identifiers the venue
 * accepts, and prove the deal is untouched — it keeps acquiring and finishes
 * normally, instead of decoding the cancel as a deliberate user STOP and
 * permanently relinquishing the rest of the entry (decide.ts's
 * "maker canceled on venue = STOP" branch, which nothing can undo).
 *
 * The nock DELETE interceptor deliberately performs a REAL cancel on the fake
 * venue: if the guard ever leaks, the maker actually dies and the assertions
 * below fail loudly rather than passing on a technicality.
